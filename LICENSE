Notices:
  This project was developed as part of my personal portfolio.
  It demonstrates a complete Data Science pipeline applied to
  public epidemiological data — from automated ETL (Santé Publique
  France / data.gouv.fr) to an interactive Streamlit dashboard,
  featuring official SPF indicators (incidence rate, positivity rate,
  7-day rolling averages), automatic epidemic wave detection via
  SciPy find_peaks, and a 7-day predictive model using Facebook
  Prophet trained on 1,141 days of real COVID-19 data.
